This a demo repo for Bonza√Ø Digital appliant's test
It contains default files for :
- composer (composer.json)
- node (packages.json)
- grunt (gruntfile.js)

You NEED to have these three files in your project to be able to deploy through cap, as he will run grunt and composer tasks.
Take necessary actions for the project to work correctly.

You can take this as an example, but must create your own repository for the test's purposes.

This repo should've installed most of the Zend 1.1x library.
Take necessary actions to add subsequent modules and make everything available within your project.
